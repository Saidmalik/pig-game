**Desciption** <br/>
This is a simple game for two players. The first player rolls the dice and his points are summed up, in order to save the accumulated points, he will have to pass the turn to another participant until the number 1 falls out. When the number 1 falls out, the points earned for this round are reset to zero and the turn passes to another player. The first person who scores 100 points wins.
